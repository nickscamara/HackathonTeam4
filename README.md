### Philosophy behind the Design
"Achieve fun through education"

While we believe that education is the primary objective of our app, we are instead shooting for a long term community of engaged active users that love the app, come back to the app, get their friends to use it, and share it on social media. There are many online scantron style quizzes that are done in 20 minutes and forgetten just as quickly. By making the app fun to use, users will naturally come back and be exposed to more knowledge in the long run.

We are not meant to be a primary source of information, we instead serve as the catalyst for users to go out and do their own research on topics that they may have not been aware of until seeing it in question in our app.
